# yo, i got a question ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

frequently asked questions (faqs) about quazar.

## i get an error when i try to start it. why?

i'm still figuring out the nuances of how to publish beta mac software! if you're getting an error, please head to the [troubleshooting section](/installation#step-35---troubleshooting-%EF%B8%8F) on the installation page

## can use quazar with my existing key?

not yet. the `cel-key` utility has not yet been added to quazar. if you'd like to make a pull request on github to add support for this, feel free!

## if i upgrade the app, will i still be able to use my existing key?

yes, but only if the chain-id does not change. if you upgrade from a version with `arabica-8` to one with `arabica-10`, this will be a new chain, and technically new account on the chain. be sure to check the release notes of the latest version you're using [on github](https://github.com/jcstein/node-app/releases)

## can i contribute to quazar?

of course! please find good first issues [here](https://github.com/jcstein/node-app/issues?q=is:open+is:issue+label:%22good+first+issue%22), but please don't let this restrict your imagination üòé
